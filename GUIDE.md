1. What happens with realtime?
   setTimeOut() maybe is better
   or in the axios? / localState // maybe I can pass a boolean, to see realtime
2. Where can I create formula or put my functions to do maths stuff?

3. Where can I put the data to save to DB?

4. Problems with the order of the symbols

5. Set favorite
   useContext() is similar to REDUX, but REDUX is much better in optimization, using devTools

- First api, set a list with the value of the API
- Conditions on the Rendering on the .map // using styling
- Other list, everytime beofre render, do some calculations
-
